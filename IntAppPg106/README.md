This C# application requests an integer from the user and then divides that integer one by one by the integers in a pre-set list. The console displays the dividend to the user as well as a description of the operation performed.
There are also try, catch, and finally blocks to handle exceptions - the exceptions the catch blocks anticipate include user inputs of 0 and non-whole integers.
